Assigement: project Trip planner 

Part 1 – Greeting

First, you’ll want to greet your user and ask them their name. Once your user tells you their name use it(on your greeting use the name) to greet them!
Then ask them where they would like to go. Finally, tell your user their destination sounds like a great trip.
HINT: Some names and destinations are more than 1 word! Plan accordingly.


Part 2 – Travel time and Budget
For this part, you’ll want to ask the user about how much time and money they are budgeting for their trip. Ask the user:
1.	How many days are they going to spend in their destination?
2.	What is their total budget for the trip in USD?
3.	What is the currency symbol for their destination? For example, the us dollar’s is USD, the euro’s is EU etc…
4.	The conversion rate between 1 USD to however many of that destinations currency. For example, there are 0.9 euro to 1 usd, so the user would type in 0.9
Once you have all this info (stored in the correct variable types), use it to tell the user the following information:
1.	How much time the user will spend at their destination in days, hours, minutes and seconds
2.	Show the user their budget in USD for the whole trip and how much they can spend in USD per day
3.	Show the user their budget in the travel destination’s currency for the total trip and per day
HINT: keep in mind that if you divide integers you might lose some information when it truncates.
